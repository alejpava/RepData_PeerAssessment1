## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Assignment

This assignment will be described in multiple parts. You will need to write a report that answers the questions detailed below. Ultimately, you will need to complete the entire assignment in a single R markdown document that can be processed by knitr and be transformed into an HTML file.

Throughout your report make sure you always include the code that you used to generate the output you present. When writing code chunks in the R markdown document, always use echo = TRUE so that someone else will be able to read the code. This assignment will be evaluated via peer assessment so it is essential that your peer evaluators be able to review the code for your analysis.

For the plotting aspects of this assignment, feel free to use any plotting system in R (i.e., base, lattice, ggplot2)

Fork/clone the GitHub repository created for this assignment. You will submit this assignment by pushing your completed files into your forked repository on GitHub. The assignment submission will consist of the URL to your GitHub repository and the SHA-1 commit ID for your repository state.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Download, unzip and load data into data frame `data`.



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Sum steps by day, create Histogram, and calculate mean and median.

The mean is 1.0766189 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> and the median is 10765

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Calculate average steps for each interval for all days, plot the Average Number Steps per Day by Interval and find interval with most average steps.

The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the data set, containing the maximum number of steps is 835.

## Impute missing values. Compare imputed to non-imputed data.

Missing data needed to be imputed. Only a simple imputation approach was required for this assignment. Missing values were imputed by inserting the average for each interval. Thus, if interval 10 was missing on 10-02-2012, the average for that interval for all days (0.1320755), replaced the NA.



Zeroes were imputed for 10-01-2012 because it was the first day and would have been over 9,000 steps higher than the following day, which had only 126 steps. NAs then were assumed to be zeros to fit the rising trend of the data.



Recount total steps by day and create Histogram.

Calculate new mean and median for imputed data.



Calculate difference between imputed and non-imputed data.



Calculate total difference.


* The imputed data mean is 1.0589694 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
* The imputed data median is 1.0766189 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is -176.4948964
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is 1.1886792
* The difference between total number of steps between imputed and non-imputed data is 7.5363321 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>. Thus, there were 7.5363321 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> more steps in the imputed data.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


Plot to compare and contrast number of steps between the week and weekend. There is a higher peak earlier on weekdays, and more overall activity on weekends.
